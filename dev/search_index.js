To instantiate your own model type you should subtybe from this model. Additionally you need to implement the following methods to satify the interface: Mandatory Methods\n\nisprimitive: defines whether a model is standalone or is defined in terms of other models.  is the model is primitive then this should return IsPrimitive() otherwise it returns  NotPrimitive()\nvisanalytic: defines whether the model visibilities can be computed analytically. If yes  then this should return IsAnalytic() and the user must to define visibility_point.  If not analytic then visanalytic should return NotAnalytic().\nimanalytic: defines whether the model intensities can be computed pointwise. If yes\n\nthen this should return IsAnalytic() and the user must to define intensity_point. If not analytic then imanalytic should return NotAnalytic().\n\nradialextent: Provides a estimate of the radial extent of the model in the image domain.  This is used for estimating the size of the image, and for plotting.\nflux: Returns the total flux of the model.\n\nOptional Methods:\n\nintensity_point: Defines how to compute model intensities pointwise. Note this is must be defined if imanalytic(::Type{YourModel})==IsAnalytic().\nvisibility_point: Defines how to compute model visibilties pointwise.
